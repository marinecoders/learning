# Marine Coders - Learning

## Purpose

The intent of this repo is to provide a guided instruction on completing labs that will further a Marines knowledge in:

1. [Software Development](../blob/master/software-development/Course.md)
2. [Cloud Architecture](../blob/master/cloud-architecture/Course.md)
3. [Cloud Security](../blob/master/cloud-security/Course.md)

## Instruction

The projects above will support virtual training conducted by industry professionals,
advocates and service members looking to enhance our communities knowledge base.
The bottom line is we can't advocate or use services in the cloud without having
the wherewithal to deploy, secure and maintain services in the cloud.

## Course Development

The authors, advocates, and teachers of these courses will attempt to keep
instruction under (2) hours. Generally, it is recommended to use your personal
computer during these events to mitigate IT related issues that you would
otherwise encounter on the government network. As the material and instruction
is open source, non government related IT equipment is encouraged to get the
most out of the instruction period.

Courses shall attempt to breakup content into major subsections and subsections
following a similar theme to [PluralSight](https://pluralsight.com) as a reference.
